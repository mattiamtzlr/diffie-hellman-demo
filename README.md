# Diffie-Hellman key exchange demonstration
This is a simple web-based demonstration of the [Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange), a cryptographic procedure to generate a
public&nbsp;/&nbsp;private key pair as well as a shared secret key for two clients.

This was originally made for the EPFL course COM-102 "Advanced Information, Computation, Communication II".

## Challenge
If you want to attempt the challenge mentioned on the website, download the source code using the green
button `Code` above (or git-clone the repo), and open the `index.html` file in a (code) editor
(e.g. VS Code).  
Then, go to around **line 90**, where you will find the instructions. Good luck!

Hint: if you can't think of anything, have a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbGB__V8MNk)
